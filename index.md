Lab Report 4

## Task 1 - logging into ieng6

`<up>`
I pressed <up> once because the command `ssh cs15lfa23sz@ieng6.ucsd.edu` was one up in my command history. 

## Task 2 - Cloning the forked repository

## Task 4 - Fixing the vim file

`<vim ListExamples.java><?index1><l><l><l><l><l><l><i><backspace><2><ESC><:wq!>`

I then pressed `enter` to jump to the line, and pressed `<l>` 6 times to move to the digit 2. I then pressed `i` to enter insert mode and pressed `<backspace>` to delete the 1, typing a `2`.
